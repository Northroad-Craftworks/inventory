        Some items are really just variations of other items. For example, a `widget` might come in the `blue-widget` and `green-widget` varieties.
        Since other platforms support variations -- and may even use them to organize product listings -- it'd be useful if we support them as well.

        What statements need to be true for this to be considered finished?
        - Use `- [ ] ` to make checkable items for tracking purposes.
        - Use present-tense statements, as shown in the example.
        - Leave this blank if exit criteria haven't been determined yet.
      placeholder: |
        - [ ] An item can be marked as a variation of another item
        - [ ] An API is available to query all the variations of an item

        So far, there three options under consideration:
        - **Child-to-Parent**: We could add a `variantOf` field to the Item model, to link variants to their parent item
        - **Parent-to-Child**: We could add a `variants` field to the Item model, to give each item a list of variants.
        - **New Model**: We could add a new Variation model, separate from Item, to track these.
        
        There are pros and cons to each options. Ideally, we should look at how other platforms (Etsy? Square?) handle this, and mirror a common design.
